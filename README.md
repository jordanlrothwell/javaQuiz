# JavaSciz: A JavaScript Quiz

## Description

A multiple-choice quiz about JavaScript.

[Link here.](https://jordanlrothwell.github.io/javaQuiz/)

## Features

1. A timer which can be adjusted, along with bonus time and punishment parameters based on correct/incorrect answers respectively.

2. Supports variable option length for questions, dynamically adding a number of option elements based on how many options a given question has.

3. Keeps track of high scores using local memory, and only prompts a user to save their score if it is within the top 10.

## Future improvements

- Allow users to adjust the difficulty
- Allow users to add their own questions
- Proofread question content
- Finish commenting code (html, CSS & JS)
- REFACTORING (submitted version *very* sloppy)

## Credits

The bulk of the CSS styling was based on [this](https://dev.to/codingnepal/create-a-quiz-app-with-timer-using-html-css-javascript-55lf) example.

Question content was based on a triaged version of [this](http://mcqspdfs.blogspot.com/2013/08/60-top-javascript-multiple-choice.html) list (requires proof-reading as a future improvement).
